Example:
    motel = [0000000000010000]
    hotel = [0000000100000000]
    vocabulary = [0000000100010000] = motel + hotel
limitiations:
    vector_size = O(size of vocabulary)
        Example: 
            given language with 500000 words
            vector_size = 500000
        human language effectively inifinte, due to derivisional morphology.
    
    no narutal notion of similarity
        hotel not equal motel, because they are different(discrete) entities
        hotel not similar to motel in discrete representation.  
            solution: 
                1. similarity matrix
                    limitation: large size 
                2. use NLTK Worndet
                    limitation: incomplete
