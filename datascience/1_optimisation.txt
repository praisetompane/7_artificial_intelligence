def: Model understand scenarios where you have:
    - an objective(a measurable value, condition etc)
        - that you want to minimize | maximize
    - a set of constraints (can be empty)

Optimisation
    properties:
        - objective: the thing you want to achieve/do/complete
            - objective function
                either to minimize or maximize
                operations = {maximize | maximize}
        - set of constraints
            can be empty
            - eliminates solutions
    Examples: Going to Cape Town from Jozi either by Bus/Train/Flight    
        - Given:
                Flight cost = 2 hours, R1000
                Train = 168 hours, R250
                Bus = 72 hours, R450
        
        - objective: Find route that minimizes the total travel time
            - objective function: number of minutes spent in transit
        
        - set of constraints:
            only have R500 to spend
        
        ∴   Bus route, 72 hours at R450 cost
    
            (Flight, 2 hours) < ((Bus, 72 hours), (Train, 168 hours))
                (Flight, R1000) > (Constraint, R450)

            (Bus, 72 hours) < (Train, 168 hours)
                (Bus, R450) < (R500, Contraint)

Optimisation problems:
    - KnapSnack problem
        - Types of this problem:
            - 0/1 version: take whole item(s) or not
                - a choice affect future options
            - Continous version: allowed to take pieces of items.
                solution: 
                    - keep taking item pieces until KnapSnack is full or item has ran out, then
                    repeat for the next most valuable.
                    - Greedy algorithm
                    - Easy to solve

        - Informal Definition:
            Context:
                Given:
                    Material
                        Gold, Silver, Raisans
                    KnapSnack(Bag), with limited(finite) capacity
            
            Objective: Take material(s) with the highest total value
                objective function: highest total value
                    operation: maximize

            Constraint:
                material has to fit in KnapSnack
                    
        - Formal Definition:
            - item I: pair <value, weight>
            - knapsack total weight: w
            - Vector L: list of available items
                length: n
                type: item = (value, objective_function_value)
            - Vector V: list of items taken
                length: n
                type: bit
                    when:
                        1, item is taken
                        0, item is not taken
                        Example:
                            When:   
                                V[3] (item 3) = 1, then item 3 is taken
                                V[1] (item 1) = 0, then item 1 is NOT taken

            - Objective: 
                Find a V that maximizes
                    n-1
                    Σ V[i] * I[i].value
                    i=0
                    
                    subject to the constraint that
                        n-1    
                        Σ V[i] * I[i].weight <= w 
                        i=0

                In english: 
                Find a V that maximizes 
                    the sum of the value of items taken =>  n-1
                                                            Σ V[i] * I[i].value
                                                            i=0
                    subject to the constraint that
                        the sum of the weight of items taken is less or equal to the max weight the knapsack can carry(w)              
                            n-1    
                            Σ V[i] * I[i].weight <= w 
                            i=0
                NB: When an item i is not taken, V[i] = 0
                    ∴ the product is 0 * V[i].weight | 0 * V[i].value, which both equal 0
                    ∴ does not contribute to the total weight or value taken 

        -  Solution:
            - Brute force: 
                - enumerate all possible combination of items(subsets)
                    i.e. the powerset 
                            this includes the empty set
                    - remove all subsets whose total weight exceeds the allowed weight
                    - from the remaining subsets, choose anyone whose value is the largest
                        - can have draws, return anyone.

                - Complexity: O(2ⁿ) = exponential: This is impractical and takes too long
                        All the possible states the V can be in
                        Given n = 10
                                2¹⁰ = 1024, possible states for V

            - any other less complexity solution? = No othe solutions, we need to generate all possible combinations.
                many optmization problems are inherently exponential.
                    there exists no algorithm with less than exponential complexity.

            - Practical alternatives based on the brute force(NOT PERFECT solutions => one of strategies to deal with computationally hard problems):
                    - greedy algorithm: 
                        while knapsack is not full
                            put "best" available item into the knapsack
                        what does "best" mean?
                            define for problem.
                        - Examples: Restuarant Meal
                            Menu
                                Food                               |wine | beer | pizza |burger |fries |coke |apple |donut |

                            Given:
                                a menu of food
                                your value for each food type

                            Objective: choose which food you want to eat
                                objective function: foods with the highest total value
                            Contraints:
                                maximum 750 calories

        Practical Example 1: 
            Informal description:
                Given:
                    Food
                
                Objective: Choose foods to eat

                Contraints:
                    maximum 1500 calories

            Mathematical description
                item: (value, weight)
                w = ??
                L = (Banana, Apple, Pizza)
                V = (0,0,0)

Computation version:
    filter out items with objective_function_value <= constraint
    from filtered result:
        take item whose objective_function_value "best fits"(< | > | ==) the 
            objective function's goal(minimize | maximize)
                relative to the contraint

Insights:
    problems suitable for optmization model:
        have a objective(a value, conidition, etc) that you are trying to maximise | minimizes
        have a set of constraints (can be empty)
