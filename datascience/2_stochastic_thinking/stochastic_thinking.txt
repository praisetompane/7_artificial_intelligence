def: handle uncertainty in computation models 

physics observation(quantum physics): the world is inherently unpredictable?

predictive nondeterminism: the fact that we(observers), do not have all(complete) information about the world, suggest we must treat it as inherently unpredictable.
    stochastic process - ongoing process
                            whose next state
                            depends on previous state + some RANDOM element
                            
        Examples specification:
            def roll_dice():
                """return an int between 1 and 6"""
                
            def roll_dice():
                """return a randomly chosen int between 1 and 6"""
                
        Examples implementation:
            import random
            
            def roll_dice():
                """return an int between 1 and 6""" 
                random.choice([1,2,3,4,5,6]) #uniform distribution = equally probable to choose any number
                
            def test_roll_dice(rolls):
                result = ''
                for i in range(rolls):
                    result += str(roll_dice())
                print(result)
                
            Given:
                rolls = 5
            
            How probable is it to return "11111"(string of 5 ones)?:
                use discrete probabily:
                    count number of events with property of interest(i.e. are "11111")
                    divide by
                    all possible events: all possible results of 5 rolls= 6^5
                        e.g. 11111, 11112,11115 ... 21342,12342,
                answer = 1/6^5 = unlikely
            
            Basic prbability facts
                - probabilities range from 0 to 1
                    0 = is not probable
                    1 = definitely probable
                - if an event has probability (p), the probability of it not happening is (1 - p) 
                - if two events are indepedent
                    the probability of the events happening
                    is the product
                        of the prabilities of the events
                        
                    Example:
                        Given 
                            probability of
                                event A = 0.5 
                                event B = 0.4
                        Probability of Event A and B
                            A * B
                            0.5 * 0.4
                            0.2
                            Note it is lower, which is expected.
                            Q: Probability of both happening has to be lower, but WHY?
                            
                    Two events are independent if
                        the result of one event does not affect 
                            the result of the other one
                
                Simulation:
                    1. Run large sample size depending on the rarity of the event
                    2. Be explicit that the result is a sampled probability
                    3. No need to simulations, if the probability can computed analytically(in a closed form solution)
                        e.g. probability of '11111' from 5 consecutive dice rolls = 1/6^5
                                i.e. 6 possible value = *, **, ***, ****, *****, ******
                                     5 rolls
                                     1 => at least one 5 consecutive dice roll returning 11111
