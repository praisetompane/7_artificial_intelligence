def method to model and handle uncertainty in computation models in which
    we are modelling and trying to understand the real world or a world with uncertainty.

CONTRAST: In classical programming we encode a set of deterministic rules, for a 
                world(domain) that are creating.
                rules:logic, expected data
                In the event of an invocation of the process that violdates the rules, we fail gracefully.

physics observation(quantum physics): the world is inherently unpredictable?
def predictive nondeterminism: the fact that we(observers), do not have all(complete) information about the world, suggest we must treat it as inherently unpredictable.

CONTRAST: def deterministic process: process that given the same input produces the same output.³ 

def stochastic process: process in which the output can depend on a random element.⁴
    properties:
        usualy uncertain output
        ∴ use PROBABILISTIC STATEMENTS to describe the possibe output 
                            
        Example specification:
            def roll_dice():"""return an int between 1 and 6"""
                Underdetermined specification  
                    do not neccessarily know the next value BUT does NOT have REQUIRE randomness
                    Can return:
                        a different value each roll
                        return the same value each roll
                
            def roll_dice(): """return a randomly chosen int between 1 and 6"""
                Stochastic specification
                    REQUIRES a random value to be returned each call
            
            Refer to "0_roll_dice.py" for example implementation of both specs
