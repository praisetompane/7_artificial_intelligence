a description of computations 
    that provide useful information
        about the possible behaviors 
            of the system being modelled.

def simulation model: an experimental device that mimics the behavior of a real world system.¹ 
    use cases:
        used to predict the future state of a system.
        in leau of expirements too expensive, dangerous, time consuming etc to perform in real life.
    NB: DO NOT produce extact results.

ENGLISH: 
    A description of actions
    AND the possible behaviors/results in the system

Use case: 
    - Model mathematically intractable systems
    - Extract intermediate results/state of process/computation/system
    - Model increasingly complex and/or cumulative what if scenarios
