a description of computations 
    that provide useful information
        about the possible behaviors 
            of the system being modelled.

ENLISH: 
    A description of actions
    AND the possible behaviors/results in the system

Use case: 
    - Model mathematically intractable systems
    - Extract intermediate results/state of process/computation/system
    - Model increasingly complex and/or cumulative what if scenarios
