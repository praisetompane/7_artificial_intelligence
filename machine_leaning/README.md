def model: an experimental device that can help us understand something that:
    - has happened
    - hasn't heppened(maybe will happen, the model will tell us)

def machine learning: the science of teachine computers to learn without being
                      explicitly programmed.
                      
Kinds of models:
    Optmisation
    Statistics
    Simulation

    Optmisation
        properties:
            - objective function
                either minimize or maximize the objective function
            - set constraints
                can be empty

        Example:    
            objective: fastest route from Cape Town to Jozi
                objective function: number of minutes spent in transit
                set of constraints:
                    only have R500
                âˆ´ only Bus, 72 hours
